# AI Math Tutor - Development Plan

## Completed
- [x] Implement base Agent class
- [x] Create initial StudentAgent with validation logic

## In Progress
- [ ] Implement TeacherAgent for problem generation and review
- [ ] Set up integration between TeacherAgent and StudentAgent
- [ ] Implement iterative review process (max 3 iterations, 2-min total time limit)
- [ ] Add timeout management (30s per iteration)
- [ ] Implement solution generation with grade-appropriate explanations
- [ ] Add error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Next Steps
1. Test the StudentAgent with sample problems
2. Implement the TeacherAgent class
3. Set up the communication protocol between agents
4. Add logging and monitoring
5. Create unit tests for both agents
6. Document the API and usage examples

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual agent methods
- Integration tests for agent interactions
- Performance testing for timeout handling
- Edge case testing for problem validation
