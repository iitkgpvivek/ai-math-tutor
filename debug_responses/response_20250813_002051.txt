  "math_problem": {
    "problem": "Find the area of a triangle given its base (b) and height (h)",
    "explanation": "The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is: Area = (1/2) * Base * Height. In this case, you substitute b for the base and h for the height."
  },
  "math_problem_variation": {
    "problem": "Solve for the side length (s) of a right-angled triangle if you know two sides: leg1 (a) and hypotenuse (c)",
    "explanation": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Mathematically, it can be written as c^2 = a^2 + b^2. In this case, you substitute a for leg1 and c for hypotenuse."
