=== ORIGINAL RESPONSE ===
{
 "math_problem": {
   "problem": "Solve for x in the following quadratic equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0",
   "explanation": {
     "step_1": "Rewrite the equation into the standard form of a quadratic equation: x^2 + (b/a)x + (c/a) = 0",
     "step_2": "Use the quadratic formula to find the solutions for x:",
     "quadratic_formula": "x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)",
     "step_3": "Plug in the values of a, b, and c from the original equation into the quadratic formula.",
     "step_4": "Calculate the discriminant (b² - 4ac)",
     "step_5": "Determine the number and type of solutions based on the value of the discriminant:",
      "- If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. Use the quadratic formula to find both solutions for x.": {
         "example": "If a = 1, b = -5, c = 6, then the solutions would be x₁ = (5 + sqrt(29))/2 and x₂ = (5 - sqrt(29))/2"
       },
      "- If the discriminant is zero, there is one real and repeated root. Use the quadratic formula to find the single solution for x.": {
         "example": "If a = 1, b = -4, c = 1, then the solution would be x = -2"
       },
      "- If the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions. The roots are complex and imaginary.": {
         "example": "If a = 1, b = -5, c = 9, then the equation has no real solutions"
       }
